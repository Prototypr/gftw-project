# Creating an Open-Source, Web Monetized Prototypr Platform

This is an open source, living documention on the development of the Prototypr Grant for The Web Project: ["Democratising Design Education with a Web Monetized Publishing Platform"](https://prototypr.io/post/announcing-prototypr-grant-for-the-web-flagship-project-%f0%9f%8e%89/). Here you'll find the steps we're taking to build our Web Monetized publishing platform from the ground up - everything from creating the [front-end website](/front-end) and the [back-end content management system](/back-end), to deploying the app in the cloud. You'll be able to learn how to build your own, or even fork your own version of ours!
